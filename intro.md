Design is a multidisciplinary field. More than that, design permeates our world. The devices you own, the house you live in, the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the grocery store you shop in...they're all designed carefully to benefit you, the product's usability, the company's bottom line...the list goes on. While it's easy to think design is purely visual, design actually encompasses so much more.

At the heart of it, design is about solving problems. Bj√∂rn Hartmann, an EECS professor, said that "design is a larger process that begins with finding out opportunities for improving the world around you.""

[John Maeda](https://about.me/johnmaeda), past president of RISD and current partner at KPCB, separates 'design' into three categories: physical design, cognitive design, and social design. These categories are still broad generalizations.
