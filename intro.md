Design is multidisciplinary in nature. It is a factor in everything, everywhere you go. The devices you own, the house you live in, the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the grocery store you shop in&mdash;they were all designed for a particular purpose.

Design touches far more different fields than we could possibility ever list on one page, but below are some design disciplines that have active communities and opportunities on campus. While the disciplines may seem diverse and unrelated, what they all share is mission to solve problems, improve the world around us, and to create better experiences for people.
