Design is multidisciplinary. It is a factor in everything, everywhere you go. The devices you own, the house you live in, the clothes you wear, the car you drive, the grocery store you shop in&mdash;they are all designed carefully to be usable, functional, marketable, profitable, and aesthetic. While it's easy to think design is purely visual, design is actually a skillset that applies to many different disciplines.

At the heart of it, design is about solving problems. Bj√∂rn Hartmann, an EECS professor, said that "design is a larger process that begins with finding out opportunities for improving the world around you."

[John Maeda](https://about.me/johnmaeda), past president of RISD and current partner at KPCB, separates 'design' into three categories: physical design, cognitive design, and social design. These categories are still broad generalizations.

Below are some design disciplines that have active communities and opportunities on campus.
