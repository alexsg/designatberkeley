      <h3><a href="http://asaeberkeley.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Aero-Design SAE</a></h3>
      <p>Bear Works is an engineering-oriented design team that competes annually in SAE's Aero-Design West Competition. Most of our efforts are geared towards designing, building, and flying our competition planes, but we do plenty of other work on the side, from social events to workshops.</p>

      <h3><a href="dec.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">CalSol</a></h3>
      <p>The UC Berkeley Solar Vehicle Team is a student-run organization that designs, builds, tests, and races solar vehicles capable of traveling at highway speeds. Hands-on experiences provide students with the opportunity to create complex systems that come together in the production of road-legal solar cars while also gaining exposure to project management and real-world engineering.</p>

      <p>Cal Enviro is a water treatment competition team that participates in the annual ASCE Mid-Pacific Conference. Every year, we're given a scenario, wastewater recipe, and list of materials to use. From this list, Cal Enviro has to design a filter that can treat the wastewater to reasonable quality.</p>
