We are a group of interdisciplinary Berkeley students with the goal of creating and strengthening the design community across campus. We also aim to promote design education, culture, and awareness.

Together with the Engineering Student Council, companies such as Google, and various design groups across campus, we have hosted numerous of design events, from prototyping workshops to industry guest speakers and designathons.

The Design Council meets every Friday from 3pm to 4pm in 360 Hearst Mining Memorial Building.
