On April 4th and 5th at UC Berkeley’s Sutardja Dai Hall, several of Berkeley’s design oriented organizations, including 3D Modeling Club, Design Engineering Collaborative, and Design Council, hosted UC Berkeley’s first ever 3D Printing Designathon. The competition required students to design and 3D print a prototype to improve the life of a UC Berkeley student.

With over 70 initial participants, the event started at noon on Saturday and lasted 24 hours. Corporate sponsors for the event included Autodesk, Sculpteo, MadeSolid, and Type A Machines. In addition, Brad Kohlenberg, Business Development Engineer from Made In Space, gave a presentation on 3D Printing and the exciting new frontiers it presents.

By 10:00 am the next morning, 14 teams finalized their designs and prepared their presentations for the Designathon showcase. A judging panel, consisting of Carl Bass from Autodesk, Brad Kohlenberg from Made In Space, Ricardo Corona from MadeSolid, Bryan Allen from Type A Machines, and Glenn Katz from Autodesk, attended the showcase and scored each team’s design. Additionally, participants took part in a popular vote to choose their favorite project among their peers.

At the end of the showcase, the votes were tallied and the winners were announced. Two teams tied for Judges’ Vote:  team Eggman, with Berni, a customizable attachment that transforms glass bottles into furniture legs and team Nice Guys, with Compact Storage Solutions, a set of Ferris-wheel shelves and a bunk bed desk that maximizes storage in dorm rooms.   Team Fennec Fox, with Lattice Lights, a decorative awning that provides light at night, won the popular vote. The winners from each team received printing credit from Sculpteo and a tour of Autodesk’s Pier 9 Workshop in San Francisco. 

UC Berkeley’s design organizations will be hosting another 3D Printing Designathon in the Fall semester, in collaboration with the newly formed Jacobs Institute of Design at UC Berkeley.
